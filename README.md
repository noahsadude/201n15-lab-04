Sian and I created a generalized function, called `findStuffInThings()`, that can be used to find a string in an array and output the index of that item, or if not output -1 (since arrays can't have negative index numbers, it made sense to do it that way).

We then built out a simple true false function `trueOrFalse()` with question inputs and the appropreate responses, and outputs a positive value if the user was successful and 0 if they are not. It has an attempts system as well, just in case I wanted it later.

Additionally, I built out both `multipleChoice()` and `guessTheNumber()`, both with outputs of either 1 or 0 if the user was successful or not, accordingly.

Thanks to:
[Danny Bullis](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37077617/javascript-store-multiple-objects-in-array-and-access-their-properties-via) for helping me figure out how to store objects in arrays.
